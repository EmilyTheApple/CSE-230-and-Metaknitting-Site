                <h2>About Metaknitting</h2>
                <p>Metaknitting has had many names throughout the years, most of them embarrassingly bad. I knitted my
                    first beard hat for a teacher in 2012 and received 3 more hat requests throughout the year. I also
                    knitted my first fish hat for a friend's birthday. I didn't seriously consider creating an online
                    business until after my first year of college. In October of 2014, just 3 months before I got
                    married, I created the first iteration of Metaknitting, only then it was called Kneards. </p>
                <p>Over the course of the next two years, I knitted over a hundred fish hats, more than a dozen beard
                    hats and a few custom orders that got me hooked on developing my own patterns. After a rather dry
                    year of orders, I closed my Etsy shop and set out into the world of online business. Since taking
                    several online business classes, Metaknitting has become my own cozy corner of the knitting world.
                    My hopes for the future are that I will be able to create, not just more adorable and nerdy knitted
                    goods, but a variety of knitting, crochet, yarn, and even cosplay related content.</p>
                <p>I have a passion for creating unique, wearable art and someday I'm going to finish my full size
                    Redwall Tapestry.</p>
